    <main>
        <p>Surviving so cleanly <br>
            My life's got no meaning <br>
            When I'm just appealing <br>
            For all the gems of your mind, yeah <br>
            The world keeps on turning <br>
            But I cast no shadow <br>
            Sucked in so sweetly <br>
            On something divine <br>
            Alone in the dark <br>
            Got stonewalled in silence <br>
            When the wolves they come barking <br>
            And the stars they don't guide me home <br>
            Why'd you run away, my friend <br>
            When you got all you wanted? <br>
            With your car flashing silver <br>
            And your teeth laced in diamonds and sulfur and jewels <br>
            I could break down all these walls ripping energy <br>
            Push aside the fear, don't waste it on the wonder <br>
           <marquee behavior="" direction="">Feel the rush, I hold the world and you're holding me</marquee> <br>
            We're coming home again <br>
            I could wake up in the ward dripping epipens <br>
            Cast away the distant sea and watch me bomb it <br>
            We can make it with love and again and again <br>
            And again and again and again <br>
            This world isn't safe <br>
            Believe me 'cause I <br>
            I'm back from the dead <br>
            So leave me in bed <br>
            And say that I didn't care <br>
            When I'm gone then I'm gone <br>
            I'm back from the dead <br>
            I'll kill you <br>
            And I'll open up the black hole in my chest <br>
            I'll give you the world <br>
            How dark does the rabbit hole go? <br>
            But will you follow me? <br>
            But will you follow me?<br>
            And will you follow me?<br>
            Love ain't looking over your shoulder <br>
            I could break down all these walls ripping energy <br>
            Now push aside the fear, don't waste it on the wonder <br>
            Feel the rush, I hold the world and you're holding me <br>
            We're coming home again <br>
            I could wake up in the ward dripping epipens <br>
            Cast away the distant sea and watch me bomb it <br>
            We can make it with love and again and again <br>
            And again and again and again <br>
            I pull the trigger on my darkness a world within <br>
            A shot of liquor, telecaster, it's under my skin <br>
            I wanna pull this place apart but the taxi's here <br>
            So wish me well upon a star 'cause I'm caving in <br>
            (That's what you get, get, get, get, get)</p>
